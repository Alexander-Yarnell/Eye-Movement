# Eye-Movement
This simple website has a set of eyes track the Users cursor around the screen. This is ran by a very simple javascript code and basic styling with css and html. 

## Instructions
Step 1. Download File. 
Step 2. Unzip folder. 
Step 3. Host website (I use XAMPP Control Panel) 
Step 4. Open index.html in any Browser. (I use Chrome) 

##Road Map 
If I was to add onto this I would add more realistic eyes. 
Make a way to chance the color of the eyes.
